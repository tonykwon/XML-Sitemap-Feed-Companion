This plugin is a companion tool for <a href="http://4visions.nl/en/wordpress-plugins/xml-sitemap-feed/">XML Sitemap Feed</a> by RavanH.

== Description ==

This plugin basically disables WordPress Canonical Redirect Filter on a virtual URL. I created this companion tool because XML Sitemap Feed Plugin DOES NOT create a physical file unlike other sitemap plugins. If SEO friendly permalink is enabled with a trailing slash, all requests to /sitemap.xml get redirected to /sitemap.xml/ as per below nginx configuration:

location / {
  index   index.php;
  try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?q=$uri&$args;
}

== Installation ==

Upload the XML Sitemap Feed Companion plugin to your blog, Activate it.
